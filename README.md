# Console-Finances

## Description
I created this repository to hold my submission for the week5 challenge which was to create a Password Generator which takes in parameters from the user through a series of prompts

This task helped me further solidify my understandings and knowledge of javascript syntaxes such as For Loops, If Statements and basic front end javascript tools.

Below is a screenshot of what the project looks like when opened in the browser console
