# Console-Finances

## Description
I created this repository to hold my submission for the week4 challenge which was to create a Financial Analysis inside the console from a dataset provided by the user 

This task helped me further solidify my understandings and knowledge of basic javascript syntaxes such as For Loops, If Statements and template literals.

Below is a screenshot of what the project looks like when opened in the browser console
